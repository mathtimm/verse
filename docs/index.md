 <b>verse</b> is an extension of the <b>prose</b> package for TESS follow-up observations and results reporting. 
 It gives access to additional features and properties specific to TESS Objects of Interest observations.  
A built-in function allows the user to model quickly the transit by making use of the <b>exoplanet</b> and <b>pymc3</b> packages and by retrieving priors directly from the TESS Transit Finder and the ExoFOP database.
<b>verse</b> creates observation reports and uploads the files directly onto ExoFOP for registered members of the TESS Follow-Up Observing Program (TFOP).
